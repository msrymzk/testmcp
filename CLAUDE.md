# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is an empty repository with no existing codebase, configuration files, or documentation. The repository is located at `/Users/yama/Documents/src/testmcp` and is not currently a git repository.

## Getting Started

Since this is an empty project, you'll need to:

1. Initialize the project structure based on the intended technology stack
2. Set up version control with `git init` if needed
3. Create appropriate configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
4. Establish development workflows and build processes

## Development Commands

No build, test, or development commands are currently configured. These will need to be established based on the chosen technology stack and project requirements.
